# TinDog 🐾

A fun, responsive **dating website for dogs** built with **Bootstrap**.  
This project is part of Angela Yu’s *The Complete Web Development Bootcamp*.

## ✨ Reflection
This project was one that I truly enjoyed. It took me a long time to complete because I was trying to squeeze the most amount of juice (learning juice hehe). Bootstrap is an amzing tool and I'm excited to continue learning more about it. 🐕💕
